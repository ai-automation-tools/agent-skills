# Archetype A — an unattended AI agent run

> Launch an agent CLI with permissions bypassed, hand it a prompt, let it work with nobody watching,
> then say what happened. Written against Claude Code; the shape transfers to any headless agent CLI.

## 1. Two shapes, and how to choose

| | **A1 — worktree + PR** | **A2 — in place** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Works on | a git repo, on a branch, ending in a pull request | a folder tree, edited where it sits |
| Isolation | a `git worktree` cut fresh from the base branch | none needed |
| Config | a routine config + a `prompt.md` | `job.json`, prompt inside the script |
| Runs via | a routine runner (yours, or the shape in §3) | `Invoke-ScheduledJob.ps1` wrapping a script that calls the CLI |
| Good for | "take the next roadmap item and build it", scheduled refactors | doc refreshes, index rebuilds, report generation |

**Choose A1 whenever the work lands in a git repo you care about.** The worktree is what makes the
job safe to schedule at all: the run cannot touch uncommitted work, cannot leave your checkout on a
strange branch, and cannot collide with whatever you are doing at noon on a Wednesday.

Choose A2 when the target is not a repo, or when a perfectly good script already exists and only
lacks a voice.

## 2. The invocation

This is the line, and every flag on it is load-bearing:

```powershell
& $ClaudeExe --dangerously-skip-permissions --model $Model `
             --output-format stream-json --verbose -p $Prompt
```

```powershell
# Piping the prompt in, so a long brief does not fight the command line:
$Prompt | & $ClaudeExe --print --verbose --output-format stream-json `
                       --model $Model --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

| Flag | Why |
|:---|:---|
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | **Mandatory.** There is no console and nobody to answer an approval prompt. Without it the session hangs until the execution time limit kills it — and the failure then looks like a timeout rather than a missing flag. |
| `-p` / `--print` | Non-interactive. Same reason. |
| `--output-format stream-json --verbose` | Emits NDJSON, one event per tool call, so the transcript shows **what the session actually did** as it happens. This is the only thing that makes a run diagnosable a week later. |
| `--model <tier>` | Per job. State it rather than inheriting the account default, so a tier change elsewhere does not silently re-price every scheduled run. |

**Preflight the CLI path before spending a session.** A moved or renamed CLI binary is the most
common break in this archetype, and failing at preflight costs nothing while failing after the
session costs the session.

**Encoding trap.** Windows PowerShell 5.1 pairs the CLI's UTF-8 stdout with the legacy OEM codepage
and mojibakes every em-dash. Set the console encoding explicitly before piping:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding           = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8
```

## 3. The A1 config

A worktree-and-PR runner needs these facts about the repo. Names are yours; the *set* is what
matters.

```jsonc
{
  "repo":   "C:\\path\\to\\checkout",
  "ghRepo": "owner/name",
  "base":   "main",
  "model":  "sonnet",

  "branchPrefix": "roadmap/auto",
  "worktree":     "C:\\path\\to\\.project-run",

  "link":       ["backend/node_modules", "frontend/node_modules", ".env", ".mcp.json"],
  "postCreate": ["./scripts/setup-links.ps1"],

  "schedule": { "dayOfWeek": "Friday", "at": "23:00" },
  "executionTimeLimitHours": 6,
  "lockHours": 12
}
```

The four that get people:

- **`base`** — `main` vs `master`. **Check the repo, do not assume.**
- **`link`** — everything gitignored that a build or test needs and a fresh worktree will not have.
  **Go and look** rather than guessing: every `node_modules` (often nested — `backend/`, `frontend/`,
  `packages/*`), every `.env`, every MCP or tool config. A **directory should be junctioned**
  (instant; `node_modules` is far too big to copy weekly); a **file should be copied** (a file
  symlink needs elevation or Developer Mode).
  ⚠️ A copied `.env` is a **real secret sitting at the worktree path** until teardown.
- **`postCreate`** — anything a fresh checkout needs done to it. A per-machine symlink or junction
  that a repo's tooling depends on is the classic case, and **its absence is usually silent**: the
  tool loads nothing and says nothing.
- **`lockHours`** — an overlap lock. A run still holding it makes the next one exit quietly rather
  than pile on; a lock older than the limit is stale and cleared.

**Tear down in the right order.** Unlink every junction *before* removing the worktree. `git` deletes
the tree depth-first, dies on a junction with a bare `failed to delete ...: Invalid argument`, and
dies **halfway** — having already removed the worktree admin data, so every later git command calls
the leftover directory "not a working tree".

---

## 4. The prompt is the product

**It cannot be copied from another job.** Nearly every disappointing run traces back to a brief that
never said what "done" means in that particular repo.

Read the repo's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / README and its docs tree first, then write:

1. **Where the work list lives**, and how an item is marked open vs done.
2. **How to choose one item**, and **what to skip because it needs a human** — spending money, filing
   or signing anything, publishing under the user's identity, anything behind an account only they
   can open.
3. **That repo's real standards** — its testing story, its doc-update obligations, the invariants it
   holds and where the rationale is written down.
4. **How to verify, and: open NO PR if verification fails.** Revert, leave the tree clean, say what
   blocked it.
5. **That repo's actual commit style.** Read `git log`. An agent pattern-matches the last project it
   saw, so a repo using conventional prefixes and one using plain sentences will get crossed.
6. **Open a PR into the base branch. Never push to the base directly.**

### Three rules any unattended prompt needs

Each was paid for by a real failed run. They apply to A2 and to hosted agents equally.

- **Never offer a choice.** Nobody answers a question at 03:00. *"Which repositories should I
  include?"* does not fail — it **stalls**, and the run is over before anything happened. Give the
  parameter, or tell the agent to pick and say which it picked.

  ```
  BAD   Summarize the release notes. Which projects should I cover?
  GOOD  Summarize the release notes for A, B and C. If a change is ambiguous,
        include it and say why you were unsure.
  ```

- **Demand explicit failure reporting.** An agent that cannot finish a step **narrates success
  instead** — it will describe the digest it would have sent. End every prompt with: *"If any step
  fails, say so explicitly in your final message and name the step that failed, rather than
  summarizing what you would have produced."*

- **Watch for pasted gutter characters.** `▎`, `│`, box-drawing rules, zero-width spaces arrive by
  copying a prompt out of a terminal, a diff, or a chat bubble. The agent reads them as part of the
  instruction and chops it into fragments it ignores. **They are invisible in an editor.** Retype
  rather than paste.

One more that only looks like a prompt problem: **reach is a separate grant.** An instruction to
email, post or fetch is inert if the run has no tool or network access for it — and the run still
reports success. State what the job can touch before you schedule it.

---

## 5. One open PR at a time

Scheduled repo work is **serial**: each run picks "the next thing not done yet" by reading the work
list on the base branch. An open, unmerged PR is therefore **invisible** to the next run — which
branches from the base, reads a list missing the previous run's work, picks the same item, and
reimplements it.

So check by **branch prefix**, not by today's branch name:

| State | What the run should do |
|:---|:---|
| A PR is open with a head starting `<prefix>-` on the same base | **Adopt that branch.** Oldest open PR wins, so a backlog drains in order. Tell the agent, in the prompt, to commit on top and comment on the PR rather than create one. |
| Base moved under an adopted branch | Merge the base in **first**. A clean merge is silent. **A conflicting one is aborted, never resolved** — unattended conflict resolution is how a run quietly deletes someone's work — and the agent is told the branch is stale. |
| No such PR is open | Fresh branch from the base, stamped with today's date. |
| The branch name is taken on origin, unmerged, with no open PR (squash-merged or abandoned) | Nothing to append to: take a stamped branch of its own, `<prefix>-<date>_<hhmm>`. |

> Why the prefix and not the name: two runs a day apart both branched from `main` while the first PR
> sat unmerged, and each independently reimplemented the same item. The two PRs shared nine identical
> files and one had to be closed.

Whatever your runner does automatically, **say the rule in the prompt too** — a run that branches by
hand gets no help from the runner at all.

---

## 6. Reporting the outcome

An agent run has more outcomes than pass/fail, and collapsing them loses the useful ones:

| Status | Means |
|:---|:---|
| `shipped` | A PR exists. Carry the link. |
| `appended` | Commits pushed onto a routine PR that was already open. |
| `no-pr` | Commits, but no PR. **Say where the kept worktree is** — do not delete it. |
| `quiet` | Nothing on the work list was completable. A complete, successful run. |
| `failed` | The run threw. Carry the error and the last ~25 log lines. |

**Check the outcome yourself rather than taking the session's word for it.** On a fresh branch that
means asking whether a PR now exists; in append mode it means asking whether the **remote tip
moved**, because a PR listing would otherwise report the PR that was already open before the run
started.

`Invoke-ScheduledJob.ps1` hands a JSON payload to whatever command `job.json` names, so the transport
is yours — email, webhook, chat, a file. For email, the `html-email-templates` skill has templates
built to survive the clients that strip CSS.

**One notification gotcha worth stating:** if a filter decides which statuses are worth sending, make
sure it names statuses *this* job can actually produce. A filter listing another fleet's statuses
switches off the whole job's reporting and nothing complains — a bug that has shipped twice.

---

## 7. Verify an agent job

**Read the step list, not the status.** A session asked to research and email a report finishes
`completed` having called only `write_file`. No status anywhere can show that; the streamed NDJSON
transcript is the only place it is visible.

Then check the things the session does not control:

```powershell
gh pr list --repo <owner/name> --head <prefix>-<date>   # did a PR actually appear?
git -C <repo> log --oneline origin/<branch> -5          # in append mode, did the tip move?
```

A run that made commits but pushed nothing should **keep its worktree**, deliberately, for you to
look at. That is not litter — but it is not cleaned up for you either.

---

## 8. Anti-patterns

- **Omitting `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.** The session hangs at the first approval prompt.
- **Running the session in the real checkout.** That is what the worktree is for.
- **Copying a `prompt.md`.** See §4.
- **Resolving a merge conflict unattended.** Abort and tell a human.
- **Re-registering a task you had deliberately disabled.** `-Force` re-enables it; re-disable after.
- **Deleting the worktree on a `no-pr` run.** It is the only evidence of what the session did.
